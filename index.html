title: My ReadyNAS Blog
excerpt: "*by sphardy:* <br/><br/>This blog ran from 2010 - 2012, documenting some of my posts made on the former ReadyNAS forum. <br/><br/>It was primarily focused on setting up ReadyNAS devices to work in a Mac / Multimedia environment.<br/><br/>It survives here as a historical archive due to the many people and web pages that still reference it."
