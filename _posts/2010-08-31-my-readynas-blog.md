After posting extensively on the ReadyNAS Forum, I've found myself repeating comments quite regularly. As there is no wiki or other means to consolidate those comments and input, I decided to setup this blog to sporadically capture some of those repeated items. Hope it helps, both ReadyNAS users, and myself (by saving a little effort)

## My ReadyNAS Setup

In the picture opposite I have a ReadyNAS Ultra-4 (black) to the left, a ReadyNAS NV+ (silver) to the right, with a GS608 Gigabit Ethernet switch between them (since upgraded to a GS108Tv2). PC to the right is a linux server I use for testing. An additional ReadyNAS Duo v2 used primarily for TimeMachine backups is not shown.

## My Network Config
